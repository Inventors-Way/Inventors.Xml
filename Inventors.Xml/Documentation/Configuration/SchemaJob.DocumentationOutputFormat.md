# Output format for the generated documentation

This attribute controls the output format of the text that are placed in the xs:documentation elements. It is only relevant when the input format is Markdown. For all other input formats the text in the documentation files are not processed, other than possible enclosed in a CDATA section or special characters are escaped (encoded).
